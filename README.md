# TaskR

TaskR is a task-management application developed by students attending California State University - Channel Islands in the Fall semester of 2019.
This application was developed for the COMP 350 - Software Engineering class, taught by Nicholas Dolan-Stern.
TaskR as an application differs from others by rewarding its users with an "experience & rewards" system.
When a user completes their task, the user is rewarded with experience, and upon receiving enough experience, they would level up.
Leveling up awards the user with new themes to change to and stickers to unlock and view.
